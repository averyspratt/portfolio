			<a class="modal_link" href="https://lawsofux.com"> The Laws of UX </a> <br>

			10 UX principles and maxims packaged in a wonderfully designed site - what more could a UXer ask for?!
			I am positive this will remain in browser tab bar as I develop the concept prototypes. One concept that I found particularly interesting, especially within the context of this project is the Zeigarnik Effect.<br></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="modal-text"> How might this apply to my product, especially with such a young target user group? How might I track students progress in a way that encourages future (and frequent) engagement? These questions (and many more) are ones I am asking myself as I enter the next stage of product development. <br>
			Excited for more to come! <br>
